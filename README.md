# Flask-API-Sample
\
PYTHON-BASED API
The API takes a user input and returns a response in a well-structured JSON object containing a timestamp and the character count of the input text.\
This project is a sample of how I used the Flask framework to create a sample API.\
Creating an API allows applications to streamlined functionality.\
The application is hosted on pythonanywhere.com.
