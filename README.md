# Flask-API-Sample

PYTHON-BASED API<br />
The API takes a user input and returns a response in a well-structured JSON object containing a timestamp and the character count of the input text. <br />
This project is a sample of how I used the Flask framework to create a sample API. <br />
Creating an API allows applications to streamlined functionality. <br />
The application is hosted on pythonanywhere.com.<br />
